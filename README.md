# **Hello, World**

The files contained in this repository are my assignment for HTML Elements for Content and Layout, Module 8 Lesson 2.

Overview:
I used HTML and CSS code to complete a series of tasks including the creation and styling of: A nav bar with links to pages in a horizontal format and custom bullet symbols, a table of information about famous movies, an image gallery consisting of images from a computer game, a user registration form including name email and password, and a user feedback form with a section for name rating and comments. Some styling effects were used to change the look of some elements when the cursor hovers over them, as well as the look of other elements in their static state. The table is styled using alternating colors for the lower rows and a different style for the table headers.
